ocean deaths / natural catastrophes<br>

five metaphors:
<ol>
  <li>time and its little machines of anvil fists</li>
  <li>family shirt cut with fingernails</li>
  <li>pigeon caught on a jagged window</li>
  <li>fatigue that spiders inside each apricot bitten</li>
  <li>a streetlamp’s capacity for sadness and the honesty of wine</li>
</ol>

two questions:
<ol>
  <li>what will the birds do? where will they land?</li>
  <li>does a heroin hit feels like a wave?</li>
</ol>

news language (excerpts from headline articles at the time):
<ul>
<li>megatsunami:</li></ul>
<p>Not all tsunamis are caused by earthquakes<Br>
All the giant waves triggered by volcanic collapses<br>
volcanoes might collapse and trigger<br>
oceanic volcanoes were said to have been swallowed by high waves<br>
quantify the size of the wave<br>
theorized megatsunami<br>
extreme geohazards such as these will eventually, one day happen, so we might as well coolly and realistically see what can be done to mitigate their effects</p>

<ul>
<li>heroin:</li>
<p>The driving force was to test the unknown<br>
pumping, pushing, pleading<br>
And then he decided not to be.<br>
breathing reflex stops<br>
Even though he burned their house down<br>
Wouldn’t it just be easier to die young and not have to see your loved ones die?<Br>
people with secrets, secrets like ours.<Br>
came to my door with soup<br>
hands flashing through open windows<br>
girl is still fire<br>
teach them the secrets to better heroin<br>
All of that hell — even before a second<br></p>
</ul>

three things that frighten you:
<ol>
<li>drowning</li>
<li>finding wounds and fingering them</li>
<li>tight cliffs</li>
</ol>

<p>
the driving force was to test the unknown
said the seismologist into his tape recorder
said the boy when he decided not to be -
</p><p>
not all giant waves are triggered by volcanic collapse
but he can feel the windows as they stutter and
swell under the wind - himself a pigeon caught in
</p><p>
jagged glass, fingernails slicing to feathers down
somewhere mothers can’t come to the door with
soup where breathing reflex stops where
</p><p>
a theorized megatsunami swallows its own
high waves by pumping, pushing, pleading,
fatigued - spidering through the wet until every
</p><p>
family shirt is soaked red and as they paused to
quantify the size of the wave to weigh those
quiet dancing ocean deaths the seismologists
</p><p>
wondered where do all the birds land
and how strange all of that hell
sliced through the air even
before a second
