    so much dead light / so intimate one feels like a voyeur / every door in the house wide open / thawed -- fought / purse -- burn -- bird / there’s nothing kind about resurrection / how the air refuses to shut behind her / evil given a name & feathers / it makes you sad, all the gouges in the wall / it gives me an excuse to fall back on

  These virgins <br>
  and their stagnant blood<br>
  hot and woolen <br>
  with shame<br>
</p><p>
  Had they learned how to swallow sooner<br>
  how to quiver like a fetal arrow <br>
  when first touched<br>
  to enjoy it<br>
</p><p>
  Instead of spending nights alone<br>
  amber foam filling each crease <br>
  of skin like soap<br>
</p><p>
  Would she still be

  <p>the awful logic of parallel lines</p>

  enters with its tired mouth and says hello,
  offers a single thread laced around its clavicle
  so i play how i remember - wind my fingers
  through memory’s still-warm slots, watch our edges align
  in a curious act of reductive addition
  - and in pulling down, feel as new tissue opens
  spilling through every shy door in the distance
