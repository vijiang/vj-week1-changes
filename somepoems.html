<div class="poem-body">
  What to do when you are <br>
  a red thing and cannot<br>
  get the colour out from <br>
  your skin. Even knives on<br>
  the table are not enough<br>
  to peel you clean. Try to<br>
  keep quiet but feels like <br>
  culling the tongues from <br>
  new calves. On wet days <br>
  you stand by the river <br>
  and feel a strange stillness <br>
  as you both wait for the <br>
  storm. When the air finally<br>
  tightens something small <br>
  inside you does too. A pinch <br>
  behind your lung. A soft pink <br>
  edge creasing. First drop splits <br>
  you from left eye down and so <br>
  Erytheia begins to seep out <br>
  in swells. Could you hear how<br>
  it cried in the times it tried to <br>
  before? Riverbed is shifting <br>
  and now the plates inside you <br>
  sing too.

<div class="poem-body">
  A sprain wakes me up at the <br>
  hinge of my sleep. Here I know <br>
  the physics of my wants are the <br>
  same: a fear­stuck stillness as the <br>
  healing begins, and then I break <br>
  my own tender mechanisms in <br>
  the dark. There is a whale in my <br>
  dream, and together we are <br>
  suspended in the thick jelly of the <br>
  ocean until I find a door in the <br>
  cage, watch his body’s slow split <br>
  as we sense how to escape. <br>
  Oddly fitting, I murmur into the <br>
  pillow. Perhaps there is a point to <br>
  my pain. In my thin faith I turn to <br>
  the window but remember that <br>
  there is no one to hear, and I am <br>
  not healing, and I wonder how <br>
  his blood stays so still in the <br>
  water.
